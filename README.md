# newzy.
A website which was inspired to me and a friend while I was still learning media query, But since then I've came a long way in making the website more responsive and good looking. See a [live version](https://mario130.github.io/Project-5-NewsWebsite/).

### Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Project duration
> It took me 6 hours over 2 days to finish the website.

### Lessons learned
Using media query gives so much control of elements sizes, possibly more than using Bootstrap in some cases.

### My portfolio
 Have a look at my works [Mario Yonan](http://mario130.github.io/Portfolio).
